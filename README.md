# Portfolio

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a professional website for All Walks Dog Training, a small dog training business. The goal is to create a new website that is more mobile friendly, has a better informational flow, and encourages more clients to the contact page. 

This will allow the business to grow while also allowing the owner to connect with the clients truly aligned with their style.

## Application Details
This is a React application that is not yet deployed. This is a mobile-first application, designed for use of mobile phones, using standard MUI breakpoints. 

App.js renders the Header and Footer components for all views of the site. It conditionally renders the About, Contact, Portfolio, and Resume sections, dependent on currentCategory state. 

### Technologies Used
Javascript/React
Material UI (MUI)
Some CSS structured in modules.

## Deployed Application:
Coming Soon.

## Future Development:
There are a few areas of future development I'd like to tackle once the front end is up and running:
- Create a database and UI for the business owner to write and post blog posts
- Have a section of the site that is password protected for clients to view extra blog posts and information
- Once the DB is created, the contact emails will also funnel through that

## Standard Create-React-App README Info
### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
